# BENGALI-V-S-ENGLISH-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING
Natural Language Processing task where we are trying to address the OOV words problem using sub-word representation technique on both English and Bengali vocabulary to test the differences.To summarize, this activity provides a good intuition on the importance of OOV rate in a language model and the ways in which it could be tackled. It also introduces us to the BPE algorithm and segmentation granularities, which are often used to overcome this issue. To conclude regarding the results, it was as expected that the Bengali language model is poorer compared to English but surprisingly led us in finding better results than the baseline model for Bengali. The hyper parameters that have an impact on the OOV rates are the hidden layers and bptt. An adequate amount of vocab size also matters. With these in right values, we can optimize oov rate to fetch a better model.
